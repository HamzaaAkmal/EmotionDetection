Thinking Process:

Understand the Core Question: The user wants to know the step-by-step process of how the browser extension (after installation from the Chrome Web Store) connects to their remote RDP server and how the system works end-to-end from the user's perspective.

Identify the Actors:

User

User's Browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.)

Al-Hudud Companion Browser Extension (Service Worker, Content Script, UI pages, local storage)

Internet

Your RDP Server (with FastAPI Backend, Database, Nginx/Caddy)

Google Gemini API

Map the Flow (User Installs -> Protection Works):

Installation: User finds the extension on the Chrome Web Store and clicks "Add to Chrome".

First Run / Installation Event: The browser downloads the extension files and installs them. The Service Worker (service-worker.js) is automatically registered and starts up. The chrome.runtime.onInstalled event fires in the Service Worker.

Onboarding Trigger: The onInstalled listener in the Service Worker checks chrome.storage.sync. It finds the isOnboarded flag is missing or false. It sets the flag to false. It then modifies browser behavior so that the next page the user tries to visit (unless it's an internal browser page or about:blank) is redirected to the extension's local welcome.html page.

Onboarding Flow: The user interacts with welcome.html, reads terms/privacy (terms.html, privacy.html). When they click "Agree and Start" on welcome.html, the onboarding.js script sends a message (action: "onboardingComplete") to the Service Worker.

Onboarding Completion: The Service Worker receives the onboardingComplete message, sets isOnboarded: true in chrome.storage.sync, and removes the onboarding redirect rule. The user can now browse normally.

Initial Backend Connection (Passive): As part of the Service Worker's startup (which happens on installation and whenever the browser wakes it up), it executes the code to loadCache() from chrome.storage.local and fetchAndApplyBlacklist() from your backend (https://your-hudud-api.com/blacklist). This is the first active connection the extension makes to your RDP server.

Blacklist Download: The fetchAndApplyBlacklist function makes an HTTP GET request to https://your-hudud-api.com/blacklist.

Backend Handles Blacklist Request: Your FastAPI backend receives this GET request. The /blacklist endpoint queries your database for the current list of harmful URL patterns.

Backend Sends Blacklist: The backend sends the list of patterns back to the Service Worker as a JSON array.

Service Worker Updates Blocking Rules: The Service Worker receives the blacklist JSON. It uses the chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateDynamicRules API to install these URL patterns as blocking/redirect rules directly in the browser's network engine. These rules are now active immediately.

Background Blacklist Refresh: The Service Worker sets a timer (setTimeout) to fetch and update the blacklist again periodically (e.g., every hour).

User Browses - Scenario 1: Known Haram Site (Blacklisted):

User types malicious-site.com.

Browser initiates network request for malicious-site.com.

The declarativeNetRequest rules (installed by your Service Worker from the blacklist) are checked by the browser itself before the request even leaves the browser process.

A rule matches malicious-site.com.

The browser's network engine immediately intercepts and redirects the request to the safe_page.html URL, as specified in the rule.

The original page (malicious-site.com) is never loaded.

The Service Worker might get a notification about the block (onRuleMatchedDebug), but it doesn't need to perform complex logic.

The user sees the local safe_page.html.

User Browses - Scenario 2: Unknown or Potentially Haram Site (Not Blacklisted):

User types unknown-site.com.

Browser initiates network request. No declarativeNetRequest rule matches.

The request proceeds. The server (unknown-site.com) responds with the page content.

As the browser starts building the page (at document_start), the content-script.js is injected into unknown-site.com.

Content script injects CSS, shows the "Scanning..." overlay.

Content script waits a short delay (setTimeout).

Content script extracts text and image URLs from the partially loaded page.

Content script sends an analyzeContent message to the Service Worker.

Service Worker receives analyzeContent.

Service Worker checks its local analysisCache (chrome.storage.local) for unknown-site.com. Cache Miss.

Service Worker prepares a request payload (text, images, URL) and makes an HTTP POST request to your remote backend's /analyze endpoint (https://your-hudud-api.com/analyze).

Your FastAPI backend receives the POST request.

FastAPI calls the GeminiAnalyzer using your pre-configured Gemini API key.

GeminiAnalyzer fetches images (if any) and sends text/image data to the Google Gemini API.

Google Gemini API processes the content and returns a classification (safe, potentially_inappropriate, haram_or_illegal).

GeminiAnalyzer parses the result, generates advice, and determines the suggestedAction (none, warn, block).

FastAPI backend returns the analysis result (classification, reason, advice, suggested action) to the Service Worker.

Service Worker receives the result.

Service Worker saves the result to its local analysisCache for faster access next time.

Service Worker checks the user's settings (strictMode, enableBlur) from chrome.storage.sync.

Based on the suggestedAction and user settings, the Service Worker determines the finalAction (none, warn, show_block_overlay, redirect).

If finalAction is redirect, the Service Worker immediately updates the tab's URL to safe_page.html.

If finalAction is warn or show_block_overlay, the Service Worker sends a message back to the content script on unknown-site.com instructing it to display the warning or block overlay and potentially apply blur.

If finalAction is none, the Service Worker sends a message to the content script to remove the scanning overlay.

The content script receives the message and updates the page UI accordingly.

User Browses - Scenario 3: Previously Analyzed Site (Cached):

User types potentially-risky-site.com (same site as Scenario 2, visited again soon).

Browser initiates request. No declarativeNetRequest rule matches.

Page load starts, content-script.js injects, shows "Scanning...".

Content script waits delay, extracts content, sends analyzeContent to Service Worker.

Service Worker receives message, checks analysisCache for potentially-risky-site.com. Cache Hit! And the entry is not expired.

Service Worker uses the cached result (classification, reason, advice, suggestedAction).

Service Worker skips the backend API call.

Service Worker determines finalAction based on cached suggestedAction and current user settings.

Service Worker sends action message to content script (e.g., warn with cached reason/advice).

Content script displays the warning overlay much faster than the first time.

Incognito Mode: If the user has manually enabled "Allow in Incognito" in the browser's extension settings, the Service Worker and Content Script run in Incognito windows just like normal windows. They perform the same logic (onboarding check - should be marked complete already, blacklist check, cache check, backend analysis, UI actions).

VPNs: A VPN encrypts traffic from your browser to the VPN server, and then from the VPN server to the final destination. However, the Al-Hudud Companion extension operates within the browser process itself. The Service Worker intercepts URLs before the browser sends them out, and the Content Script analyzes the page DOM after the browser receives it. The VPN does not hide this internal browser activity from the extension. Therefore, the extension will work correctly regardless of VPN use. The connection from your Service Worker to your backend API will also typically go through the user's VPN, but this just means the connection appears to originate from the VPN server's IP address, which is normal and doesn't affect the functionality.

Summary - How it Works:

Installation: User adds from Chrome Web Store. Service Worker starts.

Onboarding: First browser window redirects user to extension's welcome.html. User agrees to terms.

Initial Setup: Service Worker loads local cache and fetches the latest harmful URL blacklist from your hosted FastAPI backend.

Pre-load Blocking: The downloaded blacklist is installed directly into the browser's network engine (declarativeNetRequest). If a user tries to visit a blacklisted URL, the browser instantly redirects them to safe_page.html before any content loads.

Content Analysis (for non-blacklisted sites):

Content script injects into page, extracts content (text, images).

Content script sends data to Service Worker.

Service Worker checks its local cache.

If not cached or expired, Service Worker sends the content data to your hosted FastAPI backend for AI analysis using your Gemini key.

Backend uses Gemini to analyze and determine a suggested action (none, warn, block).

Backend sends result back to Service Worker.

Service Worker saves result to local cache.

Service Worker combines backend's suggestion with user's settings (from chrome.storage.sync) to decide the final action.

Service Worker tells the content script (for overlays/blur) or the browser (for redirects) to execute the final action.

Local Cache Benefit: If a user revisits a page that was previously analyzed and cached, the Service Worker uses the local cached result, skipping the backend/AI call, making the response much faster.

Admin Panel: You (as the admin) access a separate web interface (your AdminPanelUI) which talks to the /admin endpoints on your hosted FastAPI backend to update the blacklist, which then gets fetched by user extensions periodically.

This system is designed so the end-user simply installs, goes through a quick agreement, and then the protection works automatically in the background, connecting to your central server for the heavy lifting (AI analysis, central blacklist).

May Allah grant you success in implementing and launching this beneficial tool!
